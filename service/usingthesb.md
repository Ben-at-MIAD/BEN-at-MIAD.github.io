## How this all works
Conditions emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic has put a limit on the number of people that can occupy the Emerging Technology Center at one time. To help ensure that all students can take advantage of ETC equipment for their coursework, we've setup a 'Service Bureau' that enables students to submit files that will be processed by ETC staff.

### The process is as follows:

1. Prepare your file for the process you need.  If you aren't sure how to do this, [email](mailto:etc_group@miad.edu) etc_group@miad.edu and we can point you in the direction of the appropriate resources.
2. Submit your file using the appropriate form. Each form has details on process and cost.
3. Wait for an email saying your work is ready, and pick it up at the designated location.

In order to make things manageable for our staff, all cuts and prints done through the service bureau have limited options. If you need to do custom work, get in touch with Kayle Karbowski or Ben Dembroski and we can arrange for you to get direct access to the necessary equipment.

### A few other thing things to keep in mind

- Give yourself plenty of time.  Prints and cuts fail. There might be a problem with your file, there may be a large backlog of work.
- If there is a problem with your file, we will let you know the nature of the issue before we start the job. We can't fix the file for you. If you need help with the file, [book an appointment](mailto:etc_group@miad.edu).
- There are costs involved. We have done our best to keep these as minimal as possible, and are close to the normal usage fees for these processes.
