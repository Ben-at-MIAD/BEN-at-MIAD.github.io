## Vinyl Cutting

The Emerging Technology Center has two types of vinyl cutters available. The most commonly used one is 'Sase', our Roland GR-420, <!--- CONFIRM MODEL NUMBER ---> a commercial cutter with a maximum cut capacity of 42". We also have 3 smaller Silhouette 'hobby' cutters with a maximum cut width of 12".

Most students will use the commercial cutter, as it is the most reliable, and is the easier to use option.  If you have a project that you think the Silhouette's are better suited for, please [email](mailto:etc_group@miad.edu) for more information.

There are two ways to access the use of 'Sase':
* Through the [Emerging Technology Center Service Bureau](/service/usingthesb.html).
    - If you know how the service bureau works, you can skip straight to the [file submission form](https://forms.gle/ajF7T9S18j9mnxNJ9)
* Making an [Appointment](mailto:etc_group@miad.edu) for 'hands on' use of the cutter.

Which option you choose is dependent on your experience level with the machines, and the complexity of the cut you are looking to make. If in doubt, send an [email](mailto:etc_group@miad.edu) to etc_group@miad.edu, or in the [ETC's Google Chat Room](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAMR7NIj0) and we can help you decide which is the best approach is for you.

## Quick Guide for using the Vinyl Cutters
There are 3 basic steps to using the laser cutters:
1. Preparing a file in the right way so the cutter can read it
2. Sending the file to the cutter and prepping the cut using the Control Panel software
3. Running the operation on the machine

You should complete step one before you are in front of the cutter, or before you submit the form. Steps 2 and 3 happen when you are working on the machine itself, so you won't do those if you are submitting a file to be processed through the service bureau.

### Preparing the File
Adobe Illustrator is the best program to create your files in because we use Illustrator to send the files to the cutter.

1. All shapes/letters you want to cut need to be "outlined" aka, they need paths.
    - When using type, select all type and go to "Object", "Expand...", "OK" to give your text outlines.
    - Shapes will use the stroke to create outlines and paths.
    - If you want to check if your file is outlined, go to "View", "Outline". Your document will convert to just outlines/paths and show you what the vinyl cutter will see. (Go to "View", "Preview" to go back to regular view)
2. We usually use 12 inch vinyl. Your document should be limited to around 10 inches one way and can be as long as you want. You may need to rotate your document to accommodate the vinyl (we'll talk more about this in the next section.) If you need your smallest side to be larger than 10 inches, we do have 24 inch vinyl available (this costs more, so take that into consideration!)
**NOTE:** *Very fine detail or very small text can result in tearing! This will ruin your cut. If this happens, you will need to adjust the detail in your file.*
3. Your file should now be ready to send to the service bureau using the [vinyl cutter order form](https://forms.gle/iHpZYidYTXM5UScNA).

### Sending the File to the Cutter
1. In Illustrator, there should be a box open to the right side of the window titled "Roland CutStudio". If it is not there, you can open it by going to "Window", "Extensions", "Roland CutStudio"
2. The "Model:" section should have GR-420 listed.
3. If you didn't already outline your text, you can do so in the Roland CutStudio extension by selecting your text and clicking the "A" icon.
4. You can also outline strokes, merge overlapping paths, etc. with the icons next to the Outline Text "A" icon.
5. Scaling, rotating and mirroring your file can also happen in this menu.
6. Select the Output Path by clicking the drop-down menu below the outline icons.
7. "Output All Lines" will cut anything in the document, including outside the artboard.
8. "Output Selected Lines" will cut everything you have selected with the Illustrator "Selection Tool". There are many other output options, but these are the ones most commonly used.
9. We recommend you check the "Move to Origin" box. This helps us minimize the amount of vinyl used to cut your file.
10. If "Auto Update" is not checked, check the box to see the preview box change every time you make a change in the Roland CutStudio extension box.
11. Rotate your file so that it uses the least amount of length of vinyl needed to cut your file.
12. When you are satisfied with your preview, click the blue and yellow icon near the Model information at the top of the Roland CutStudio extension box.
13. A "CutStudio Output" dialogue box will pop up. Continue to the next section of this Wiki to operate the cutter and finish your project!

### Operating the Cutter
**NOTE:** *A large portion of these instructions apply specifically to using the in-house vinyl. If you are using your own vinyl or a different material, consult a lab monitor to adjust the cutter to fit your needs.*
1. Turn on the vinyl cutter by flipping the power switch located on the right side of the machine, right under the gray handle.
2. If a lab monitor has not yet loaded the vinyl, ask them to load the vinyl you would like to use. We have white and black vinyl. If you are using your own vinyl or a different material, let the lab monitor know.
3. There are 3 small black rollers on the machine. These must be aligned to the white/silver bars above the cutter belt in order for the machine to work. The two on the ends should be as close to the left and right edge of the material as they can be while still being under the white/silver bars. The middle one should be somewhere in the middle of the material.
4. There is also a small censor that must be covered by the material. It is located right in front of the roller area about a foot and a half in from the right side of the machine. When covered, it will activate a slight air suction that will help keep the material in place.
5. Back up the material so there is the least amount of excess. (Right behind the white markers on the black surface of the cutter should be good)
6. The first thing on the screen should be "Select Sheet". In most cases you should select "Roll" as you are cutting vinyl that is on a roll. There will be an * next to the current selection.
7. Once you feel you have everything aligned properly and the correct type of "sheet" selected, press the "PINCH" button. The machine will make some loud clicking noises while the three rollers lower to hold the vinyl in place.
8. Press "CUT CONFIG"
9. When cutting the in-house vinyl, the FORCE should be set to about 80gf and the SPEED should be set to 30 cm/s. Use the up and down arrows to check these settings. These settings will likely need to be modified if you are working with a different material/vinyl. Ask for a lab monitors assistance with this and run TEST CUTS before moving on to your project.
10.  Press "MENU" once you are satisified with the FORCE and SPEED.
11. Press "ENTER"
12. The blade head will move to the left most roller. On the screen "W:" will list the maximum width it can cut. Adjust your rollers and/or file as need be.
13. Press the forward arrow to ensure your material is straight and doesn't go off any of the rollers. (You can press the "ENTER" button at the same time as the forward and backward button to make it move faster!)
14. If the material does, press "PINCH" to release the material and adjust the angle. Press "PINCH" again to set it. You may have to do steps 13 & 14 a few times.
15. Be sure to back up the material again using the arrows to minimize material waste.
16. Press and hold the "ORIGIN" key until "ORIGIN SET" blinks on the screen. The "ORIGIN" associates with the bottom left corner of the preview box in the Roland CutStudio box in Illustrator. This is where your cut will end.
17. Return to the computer. If CutStudio Output dialogue box is still up, you can press "Cut". Otherwise, press the yellow and blue icon in the Roland CutStudio box in Illustrator again (once all your adjustments and settings are correct)
18. Your cut will begin!
**NOTE:** *If you did have fine details in your file, tearing may happen. If you see this happening press "PAUSE" and let a lab monitor know. It may be your file, but there could be some things happening with the machine as well.*
19. Once it's finished, move the material forward about an inch and the blade head all the way to the right or left using the arrow keys on the machine. You can use a box cutter or xacto knife to cut the material along the divet in the machine between the black and silver material. Ask a lab monitor if you need help with this! You'll need to move the blade head again to cut the material completely.
20. You are done! Turn the machine off and let the lab monitor know you're finished.

### Weeding, Transferring, and Applying Vinyl
**Note** *Once you get your vinyl back from the service bureau, you can follow these steps to get your cut installed.

1. You can use an xacto knife to remove the vinyl that is supposed to be negative space in your cut. This is called "weeding".
2. Once you've finished weeding, ask the lab monitor for the transfer paper. The transfer paper is sticky on one side- you will need a card or plastic applicator of sorts to evenly adhere the transfer paper to your vinyl.
3. Cut out the transfer paper to fit your vinyl piece.
4. Peel of the back of the vinyl, exposing the sticky side of it.
5. Apply your vinyl to whatever surface using a card or plastic applicator and peel off the transfer paper.
