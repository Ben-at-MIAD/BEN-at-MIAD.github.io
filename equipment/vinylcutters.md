## Vinyl Cutting

The Emerging Technology Center has two types of vinyl cutters available. The most commonly used one is 'Sase', our Roland GR-420, <!--- CONFIRM MODEL NUMBER ---> a commercial cutter with a maximum cut capacity of 42". We also have 3 smaller Silhouette 'hobby' cutters with a maximum cut width of 12".

Most students will use the commercial cutter, as it is the most reliable, and is the easier to use option.  If you have a project that you think the Silhouette's are better suited for, please [email](mailto:etc_group@miad.edu) for more information.

There are two ways to access the use of 'Sase':
* Through the [Emerging Technology Center Service Bureau](/service/usingthesb.html).
    - If you know how the service bureau works, you can skip straight to the [file submission form](https://forms.gle/ajF7T9S18j9mnxNJ9)
* Making an [Appointment](mailto:etc_group@miad.edu) for 'hands on' use of the cutter.

Which option you choose is dependent on your experience level with the machines, and the complexity of the cut you are looking to make. If in doubt, send an [email](mailto:etc_group@miad.edu) to etc_group@miad.edu, or in the [ETC's Google Chat Room](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAMR7NIj0) and we can help you decide which is the best approach is for you.

## Quick Guide for using the Vinyl Cutters
There are 3 basic steps to using the laser cutters:
1. Preparing a file in the right way so the cutter can read it
2. Sending the file to the cutter and prepping the cut using the Control Panel software
3. Running the operation on the machine

You should complete step one before you are in front of the cutter, or before you submit the form. Steps 2 and 3 happen when you are working on the machine itself, so you won't do those if you are submitting a file to be processed through the service bureau.
