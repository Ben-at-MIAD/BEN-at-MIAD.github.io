## Laser Cutting and Etching

The Emerging Technology Center has two laser cutter / etchers available, named Jenny and Cody. They are both Universal Laser Systems PLS6.150d models, with a total available power of 150 watts for each machine. Students can process work on these machines in one of two ways:

* Through the [Emerging Technology Center Service Bureau](/service/usingthesb.html).
    - If you know how the service bureau works, you can skip strait to the [file submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4uoJjBEy1aoVjJs31U_WjWiDalBJYx3Z5DctA0Yz0UOFreg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
* Making an [Appointment]() for Hands On use of the cutter.

Which option you choose is dependent on your experience level with the machines, and the complexity of the cut you are looking to make. If in doubt, send an [email](mailto:etc_group@miad.edu) to etc_group@miad.edu, or in the [ETC's Google Chat Room](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAMR7NIj0) and we can help you decide which is the best approach is for you.

## Quick Guide for using the Laser Cutters
There are 3 basic steps to using the laser cutters:
1. Preparing a file in the right way so the cutter can read it
2. Sending the file to the cutter and prepping the cut using the Control Panel software
3. Running the operation on the machine

You should do step one before you are in front of the cutter, or before you submit the form. Steps 2 and 3 happen when you are working on the machine itself, so you won't do those if you are submitting a file to processed through the service bureau.

### How to prep files for the laser cutter (Step 1)
1. The file format is isn't important.  If you can send it to a printer, you can run the file on our laser cutters. (We usually use Adobe Illustrator in the ETC)  What *does* matter is line weight and colors in your file.
2. Files must be in the RGB colorspace
3. The default values we normally use:
    - Red (R:255 G:0 B:0) .001 point stroke width = vector cut
    - Blue (R:0 G:0 B:255) .001 point stroke with = vector engrave
    - Black(R:0 G:0 B:0) etch as raster image
4. If you are using Illustrator, make sure the file is saved as an Illustrator CC(legacy) file.
    - File -> Save As (choose Adobe Illustrator (.ai) format
    - Change the version to "Illustrator CC (legacy)"  in the next dialog box.
5. If you are using the ETC Service Bureau, submit this file using the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4uoJjBEy1aoVjJs31U_WjWiDalBJYx3Z5DctA0Yz0UOFreg/viewform?usp=sf_link). Otherwise, save the file to a flash drive and bring it with you when proceed to step 2.

### Using the Universal Control Panel Software (Step 2)
You send the file to cutter using the print dialog. All software titles do this a little differently, so use the steps below as a general guide.  If you need specific help for the software you are using, ask Kayle or Ben. The following steps are for Adobe Illustrator.

1. Use the print command from the software showing the file
2. Click the “Setup…” option in the first dialogue box
3. Then click the “Preferences” option in the next dialogue box
4. The UCP control panel will appear
5. Click on the "Materials Database” tab in the control panel
6. Select the material that most closely matches the material you are going to cut (click the +'s to open each category)
    - **IF YOU DON'T SEE YOUR MATERIAL LISTED, AND NEVER CUT IT BEFORE, ASK A LAB MONITOR BEFORE PROCEEDING.  CUTTING UNAPPROVED MATERIALS CAN RESULT IN THE RELEASE OF POISONOUS, CORROSIVE GASES.**
7. You must measure the material’s thickness using the lab’s calipers– even if the label lists a specific thickness! The majority of labels will list an approximate thickness (such as ⅛ inch or .125 inches) when the actual thickness of the material may be .123 or .119 inches.
    - *Your material must be flat*: any warped or uneven material will not cut correctly, or can cause fires.
8. Enter the material thickness in the appropriate window.
9. 10. Click “Apply”
11. Click the “Manual Control” tab
12. If doing you are doing a raster operation, select the appropriate image density / throughput ratio. Ask a lab monitor if you need assistance with this.
13. Double check the Power / Speed settings to see if they make sense (ask if you're not sure)
14. click “Set”
15. click “Apply”
16. click “OK”
17. You will return to the print dialogue box, click “Print” in the first box, and then click “Print” again in the second box to send the file to the printer.
    - *You only need to these step once if you are doing multiple cuts in the same material*.  You can just click 'Print' to send another file with the same material settings.
18. Click the arrow in the bottom right corner of the computer screen near the time and date. Select the red box with the yellow X to open the UCP Printer Driver.

### Operating the Cutter
Make sure the power switch is turned to the On position (–) on the laser cutter you are using. Power switch is located on the right side towards the bottom of the machine.

1. Make sure the ventilation is on.
2. Set the power switch to the On position (–) on the laser cutter you are using. Power switch is located on the right side towards the bottom of the machine.
3. Home the X Y and Z axis using the buttons on the UCP window.
    - Note: You must check underneath the printer bed before homing the Z axis. Do so by opening the front panel of the machine and looking to make sure nothing is underneath. If you have questions about this, ask a lab monitor.
4. Place your material in the printer bed.
5. To align your material to the path of the laser, use the “Relocate View” tool to position your file. You cannot rotate or resize in the UPC window. If you need to adjust your file, go back to Illustrator and resend your file.
    - Tip: Make sure to click on the small boxes when clicking and dragging to adjust your image. Right and left mouse clicks zoom in and out of your image.
6. You can use the “Duplicate View” tool to cut multiple copies of your file at once.
7. Once your file is where you want it, open either the front panel slightly or the top window of the machine to activate the red placement dot for the laser head.
8. Use the “Focus View” tool to move the laser around the print bed and ensure the laser is aligned with your material in the way you want it.
    - Note: You can use the up and down arrows in the UCP window to move the printer bed up and down to better focus the laser if you need to be really precise. BE VERY CAREFUL not to get too close to the laser head! Leave around ¾ inch from the material to the laser head. It will dislodge if the material bumps into the laser head and you will need a lab monitor to fix this.
9. Use the “Estimate View” tool to see how much time your file will take to complete.
10. Once you are satisfied with the placement of your material and file, turn on the air filtration system above Cody. You should hear air going through the machine. If you don’t know how to do this, ask a lab monitor for help.
11. Press the big green Play button to start your cut. If the air filtration system is not on, the cut will not start and a dialogue box will pop up informing you of this.
12. You must stay within eyesight of the machine while your project is cutting. If you need to leave for any reason, you can use the Pause button to pause the cut OR ask a friend or lab monitor to keep an eye on it. This is your responsibility! Click the Pause button again to resume. Clicking the Play button will start the cut over from the beginning.
    - Note: Fires do happen! If you see a fire start in the machine, pause your cut immediately and get a lab monitor. DO NOT OPEN THE PRINTER.
13. Once your cut is complete, give your project at least 30 seconds to cool off. Especially if you are cutting something synthetic such as acrylic, the smell from the cut can be quite chemically. Waiting to open the print bed also gives the smell time to dissipate.  


All done! Turn off the air filtration system as soon as your cut is complete. Remove your project and excess material.
