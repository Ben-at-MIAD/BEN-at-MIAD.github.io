## Laser Cutting and Etching

The Emerging Technology Center has two laser cutter / etchers available, named Jenny and Cody. They are both Universal Laser Systems PLS6.150d models, with a total available power of 150 watts for each machine. Students can process work on these machines in one of two ways:

* Through the [Emerging Technology Center Service Bureau]()
* Making an [Appointment]() for Hands On use of the cutter.

Which option you choose is dependent on your experience level with the machines, and the complexity of the cut you are looking to make.
