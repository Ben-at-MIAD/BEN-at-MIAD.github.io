## The most important thing...

... to remember is you don't need permission or a specific project to make good use of  the Emerging Technology Center. All you really need is a question. Project work is welcome here, you just don't need to start there. Depending on your interests, and what you looking to do, the ETC has several ways to support you in using emerging technology in your practice.

### Self-Directed Projects

If you have something you want to try, or a question you want to investigate, send an [email](mailto:etc_group@miad.edu) to etc_group@miad.edu and schedule an appointment to come in and try stuff out.  If you need training on the use of particular equipment we can help with that too.  Just start.  If you don't know where to start, and just have an inkling of an idea, let's chat.

### Work for the ETC

If you have an interest in working with a ride range of new technologies, and love being helpful, working in the ETC is great opportunity. The number of positions is limited, but applications are always welcome.  Email [Kayle Karbowski](mailto:kaylekarbowski@miad.edu) for more information.

### The Independent Inquiry Program

**Coming Feb 1st....**

The Independent Inquiry Program provides MIAD students the opportunity to receive philanthropically sourced funding while investigating how artists and designers can use emerging technology in ways not currently employed in MIADâ€™s curriculum.
