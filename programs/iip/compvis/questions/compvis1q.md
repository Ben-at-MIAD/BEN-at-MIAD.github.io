[About the IIP](/programs/iip/aboutiip) - [Inquire or Apply](mailto:bendembroski@miad.edu)

## What are the most versatile computer vision solutions for MIAD?

### Why this question is important, and what we are trying to figure out:
Several techniques and and processes are dependent on, or can be significantly enhanced through the use of computer vision. This question acts as the launchpad for expanded inquiries into this topic. As such, the question is framed within the context of how this technology can expand current programs of study at MIAD. Therefore, this question can assume that we are looking to investigate the most versatile, and flexible hardware solution possible, which can be used with as many software solutions as possible. Currently, the following applications are of the most interest:

- Computer Vision as an animation tool. Particularly its use in animating rigged humanoid 3D models
- Computer Vision as a real-time input for interaction systems (Projection Mapping, real-time video effects, video gaming etc.)
- Computer Vision for 3D scanning and virtualization processes

The goal of this inquiry to establish what computer vision hardware has sufficient software compatibility for all three of these applications, and to assess the quality of related software options.

### Criteria for successful inquiry

- Brief analysis of commonly employed computer vision hardware
- Assessment of likely future viability of the hardware
- Assessment of existing learning pathways and support
- Overview of software compatibility â€“ including how well the solutions integrate with workflows that commonly exist at MIAD
- Examples of use in each of the applications listed above
